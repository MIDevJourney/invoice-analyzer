# invoice-analyzer
A full-stack web app to automate invoice processing using Python (FastAPI), React, and OpenAI’s API for intelligent data extraction and analysis.  In progress—building a tool to extract, categorize, and visualize invoice data (March-June 2025).

## Progress
- **Pre-Week 1 (March 31, 2025):** Set up project structure with `backend` and `frontend` folders. Created a virtual environment and installed FastAPI dependencies (fixed a zsh bug with package installation). Set up a `.env` file for my OpenAI API key and made a successful test API call with `test_openai.py`.
